    "### 1. Functional Programming Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional programming** is a style of programming where we focus on writing functions that do not change any state or data. Instead of modifying data, functions in this paradigm return new data. This approach helps in creating programs that are easier to understand and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pure Functions\n",
    "A pure function is a function that:\n",
    "- Always produces the same output for the same input.\n",
    "- Does not have any side effects, meaning it doesn't alter any external state (like changing a global variable or modifying a data structure in place).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "# This function is pure because it only depends on its inputs x and y,\n",
    "# and it does not modify any external state.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Immutability\n",
    "Immutability means that once data is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying existing data, new data is created with the desired changes. This concept is often used in functional programming to avoid side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = (1, 2, 3)  # A tuple is immutable\n",
    "# numbers[0] = 10    # This will raise an error because tuples cannot be changed\n",
    "new_numbers = (10,) + numbers[1:]  # Creating a new tuple with a modified value\n",
    "print(new_numbers)  # Output: (10, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Higher-Order Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order functions are functions that can:\n",
    "- Take other functions as arguments.\n",
    "- Return a function as their result.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions allow for a more abstract way of thinking about operations and data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`map`**: Applies a given function to all items in a list (or any iterable) and returns a new list with the results.\n",
    "- **`filter`**: Filters items in a list based on a function that returns True or False.\n",
    "- **`reduce`**: Applies a function cumulatively to the items in a list, reducing the list to a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using map to square numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))\n",
    "print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using filter to get even numbers\n",
    "even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using reduce to sum numbers\n",
    "sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
    "print(sum_of_numbers)  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators are a way to \"wrap\" a function with another function, adding some behavior before or after the main function runs. They are useful for logging, checking conditions, modifying input/output, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Simple Decorator**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
    "        func()\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "@my_decorator\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "say_hello()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Something is happening before the function is called.\n",
    "# Hello!\n",
    "# Something is happening after the function is called.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `@my_decorator` is used to modify the behavior of the `say_hello` function. The `wrapper` function adds additional behavior around the call to `say_hello`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Closures\n",
    "\n",
    "A closure is a function that remembers the variables from the environment in which it was created, even after that environment is gone. This allows the function to access those variables later when it's called.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def make_multiplier(x):\n",
    "    def multiplier(n):\n",
    "        return x * n\n",
    "    return multiplier\n",
    "\n",
    "times_two = make_multiplier(2)\n",
    "times_three = make_multiplier(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(times_two(5))   # Output: 10\n",
    "print(times_three(5)) # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `times_two` and `times_three` are closures that remember the value of `x` (2 and 3, respectively) from the `make_multiplier` function. When `multiplier` is called, it uses the remembered value of `x` to perform the multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functional Programming**: Emphasizes functions that avoid changing state and have no side effects.\n",
    "- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them.\n",
    "- **Decorators**: A way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions.\n",
    "- **Closures**: Functions that remember variables from their creation environment, even after that environment is gone.\n"
