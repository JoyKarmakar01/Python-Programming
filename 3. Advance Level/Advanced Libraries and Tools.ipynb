    "  ```python\n",
    "  from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Sequence\n",
    "  from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
    "  from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Define the engine and base class\n",
    "  engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)\n",
    "  Base = declarative_base()\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Define a User model\n",
    "  class User(Base):\n",
    "      __tablename__ = 'users'\n",
    "      id = Column(Integer, Sequence('user_id_seq'), primary_key=True)\n",
    "      name = Column(String(50))\n",
    "      age = Column(Integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Create the table\n",
    "  Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Create a session\n",
    "  Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n",
